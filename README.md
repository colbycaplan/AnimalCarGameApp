About:

This is a simple app that acts as a score calculator for a game some of my friends made up. The game is original to my knowledge, but the app was **created by AI**. If you’d like to support me, the app will soon be available from the Google Play Store for $0.99.
Installing on iPhone:

Go to https://colbycaplan.github.io/AnimalCarGameApp/ in Safari and click the share button near the address bar. Scroll down and hit add to home screen, and you’ve successfully installed the app :)
Installing on Android:

Go to https://colbycaplan.github.io/AnimalCarGameApp/ in Google Chrome and click the three dots and then click add to home screen.

OR

Go to the Google Play Store and search for The Animal Car Game. Downloading from here will support me to hopefully make apps myself in the future.created
